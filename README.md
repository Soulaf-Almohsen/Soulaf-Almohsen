## About Me

I‚Äôm a **Human-Centered Machine Learning Engineer** driven by the belief that technology should **understand, not overwhelm**.  
I blend my skills in **Python, ML, and Data Science** on developing AI systems that are **intelligent, transparent, and human-aware** ‚Äî models that people can **trust, relate to, and enjoy interacting with**.  

With over **three years of experience in UX research and design**, I‚Äôve learned how people think, decide, and connect with technology.  
That insight now shapes how I build **machine learning solutions** that feel **natural, clear, and built for humans ‚Äî not just data**.
