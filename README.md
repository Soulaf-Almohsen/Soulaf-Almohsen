## 🤖 About Me

I’m a **Human-Centered Machine Learning Engineer** driven by the belief that technology should **understand, not overwhelm**.  
My focus is on developing AI systems that are **intelligent, transparent, and human-aware** — models that people can **trust, relate to, and enjoy interacting with**.  

With over **three years of experience in UX research and design**, I’ve learned how people think, decide, and connect with technology.  
That insight now shapes how I build **machine learning solutions** that feel **natural, clear, and built for humans — not just data**.
