## ðŸ¤– About Me

Iâ€™m a **Human-Centered Machine Learning Engineer** driven by the belief that technology should **understand, not overwhelm**.  
My focus is on developing AI systems that are **intelligent, transparent, and human-aware** â€” models that people can **trust, relate to, and enjoy interacting with**.  

With a background in **UX research and design for more than 3 years**, Iâ€™ve learned how people think, decide, and connect with technology.  
That perspective helps me create machine learning solutions that feel **natural, clear, and built for humans â€” not just data**.
